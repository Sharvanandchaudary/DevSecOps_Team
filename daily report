Goal:
The objective was to enhance the GitHub Actions automation under Cloud 3.14.5.2.0, specifically focusing on:
Implementing a robust PR Checklist validation workflow.
Deeply improving the Terragrunt CLI workflow to prevent incorrect chamber deployments and ensure consistent behavior during reruns from the GitHub UI.

Work Completed:
PR Checklist Workflow (Cloud 3-1452):
Developed and deployed a GitHub Actions workflow that enforces PR checklist completion and mandates reviewer approvals.
Ensures teams follow validation and review compliance for all incoming PRs.
Tested thoroughly and documented within the JIRA ticket.

Terragrunt CLI & OpenStack Chamber Workflow Enhancements:
Investigated issues where the workflow picked incorrect values during reruns, leading to potential misdeployments.
Designed and implemented a commit-based caching strategy to persist the correct context during workflow reruns.
Implemented a validation step at the beginning of the workflow to ensure the correct cc_chamber is picked for both AWS and OpenStack.
This prevents any unintended deployment by halting the workflow early if mismatches are found.
These changes significantly improve safety, consistency, and traceability across environments.
