metal

context
when building a rhel 8.6 image to boot on bare metal servers the image must include a proper partition layout that supports uefi firmware and rhel installation requirements

required partitions
/boot/efi – 200 mb (minimum 100 mb) – vfat – stores uefi bootloaders and is required for uefi firmware
/boot – at least 1 gb – xfs or ext4 – holds kernel, initramfs and grub configuration
/ (root) – at least 10 gb (20 gb recommended) – xfs – main operating system and application files
swap – optional 1 to 2 times ram, often 2 gb or 4 gb – swap – used for paging
/home – optional size as needed – xfs – user home directories
optional partitions /var, /tmp, /usr – only if isolating workloads

creating partitions during installation or image build
	1.	when installing using the anaconda installer
choose custom partitioning and create mount points with the sizes mentioned above
create /boot/efi as vfat 200 mb
create /boot as xfs 1 gb
create / as xfs 20 gb
create swap as needed
optionally create /home
	2.	when using a kickstart file
example snippet
part /boot/efi –fstype=“efi” –size=200
part /boot –fstype=“xfs” –size=1024
part swap –fstype=“swap” –size=2048
part / –fstype=“xfs” –grow –size=10240
	3.	when customizing an existing image
inspect with lsblk or parted -l
if /boot/efi is missing create a 200 mb partition as vfat and mount to /boot/efi
run grub2-install and grub2-mkconfig to update bootloader
ensure /boot is at least 1 gb

validation after creation
run lsblk to confirm partitions
expected layout example
sda1 200m vfat mounted on /boot/efi
sda2 1g xfs mounted on /boot
sda3 2g swap
sda4 20g xfs mounted on /

check /etc/fstab to confirm entries for /boot/efi, /boot, / and swap

minimum requirements summary
/boot – 1 gb
/boot/efi – 200 mb vfat
root – 10 gb minimum, 20 gb recommended
swap – optional 2 gb or more
filesystem – xfs by default except vfat for efi

after these partitions are created and verified the disk can be converted to qcow2 or raw, uploaded to glance, and used for bare metal boot with openstack
