Work Done Today

Tested the updated image which was created with a new device name and received an assigned IP, but during deployment the image was not able to download.
On the iDRAC console we observed the following repeating message from the ironic‑python‑agent:
ironic_python_agent.extensions.standby [-] Attempting to download image from http://<image_server> ... heartbeat successful
The deploy process did not complete and the instance remained in a build state.
Faced an issue while running the packer workflow as the branch used was a new one and there were protection rules. Raised an IT ticket for the required permissions and added the necessary updates to proceed.
Reviewed the image in iDRAC and worked with Abhishek to create a new image containing an EFI partition as referenced in the official documentation.
This image will be tested tomorrow and results will be updated accordingly.
The image creation process was challenging because I have not previously worked much on the OS side. I will continue debugging with the new EFI‑partitioned image 

Plan for Tomorrow
Test the new EFI‑partitioned image with Ironic.
Arul assigned  me to take tasks from Varsha related to chamber deployments tomorrow. I will make sure to assign the relevant tickets and help in chamber deployments.
Continue to support chamber deployments and customer support tasks as needed.
