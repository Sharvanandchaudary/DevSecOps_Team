I can see the error message clearly in your screenshot:

csharp
Copy
Edit
PCI alias gpu is not defined (HTTP 400)
VM created successfully
âœ… What this means:
You created a flavor with this property:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
pci_passthrough:alias=gpu:2
â€¦but OpenStack is telling you:

csharp
Copy
Edit
PCI alias gpu is not defined
ðŸ’¡ Why this happens
Before you can use pci_passthrough:alias=gpu:2, your OpenStack controller must have a PCI alias defined in the Nova configuration (nova.conf).
That alias (gpu) maps to actual physical GPU PCI devices on your compute hosts.

For example, in /etc/nova/nova.conf on your compute node(s) you should have something like:

ini
Copy
Edit
[pci]
alias = { "vendor_id":"10de", "product_id":"1db6", "device_type":"type-PCI", "name":"gpu" }
(The vendor/product IDs should match your GPU hardware â€” e.g., NVIDIA Tesla or A100 cards.)

After setting this, you must restart nova-compute service:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart openstack-nova-compute
Only then will OpenStack recognize the alias gpu and allow flavors that request it.

ðŸ”§ Steps to fix
Check GPU alias definition:
On the GPU compute node:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo grep -i alias /etc/nova/nova.conf
If nothing is returned, then alias gpu is not defined.

Add a GPU PCI alias to nova.conf:
Edit /etc/nova/nova.conf:

ini
Copy
Edit
[pci]
alias = { "vendor_id":"10de", "product_id":"1db6", "device_type":"type-PCI", "name":"gpu" }
Replace vendor_id and product_id with your GPUâ€™s IDs:

bash
Copy
Edit
lspci -nn | grep -i nvidia
(Youâ€™ll see something like [10de:1db6], where 10de is vendor, 1db6 is product.)

Restart nova services:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart openstack-nova-compute
Verify alias:

bash
Copy
Edit
openstack hypervisor show <your-gpu-host>
Make sure GPU devices are listed under PCI stats.

Re-create or use the same flavor with:

bash
Copy
Edit
openstack flavor create m8g.multi --vcpus 16 --ram 65536 --disk 200
openstack flavor set m8g.multi --property "pci_passthrough:alias"="gpu:2"
openstack flavor set m8g.multi --property "aggregate_instance_extra_specs:host_type"="gpu_host"
Boot your VM with that flavor again.

âœ¨ Summary
The error is because your OpenStack environment hasnâ€™t defined a GPU PCI alias in nova.conf.
âœ… Add alias in nova.conf
âœ… Restart nova-compute
âœ… Then use your flavor with pci_passthrough:alias=gpu:2

If youâ€™d like, I can help you write the exact alias JSON for your GPU once you share your lspci -nn | grep -i nvidia output. Let me know! ðŸš€

For cuda testing can you script for installing drivers and testing the vm is using gpup


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely!
Below is a ready-to-use bash script that you can run inside your GPU VM to:

âœ… Install NVIDIA GPU drivers and CUDA toolkit
âœ… Install NVIDIA utility packages (nvidia-smi)
âœ… Verify that GPU is detected and CUDA works

ðŸš€ Script: setup_gpu_cuda.sh
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "[INFO] Updating package lists..."
sudo dnf clean all
sudo dnf -y update

echo "[INFO] Installing kernel headers and development tools..."
sudo dnf -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo dnf -y install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r) epel-release dkms

echo "[INFO] Installing NVIDIA driver repository..."
# Add the NVIDIA CUDA repo (for RHEL 9.x)
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/rhel9/x86_64/cuda-rhel9.repo

echo "[INFO] Installing NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit..."
sudo dnf -y install nvidia-driver nvidia-settings cuda

echo "[INFO] Adding NVIDIA persistence daemon..."
sudo systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced
sudo systemctl start nvidia-persistenced

echo "[INFO] Reboot is recommended after driver install, but continuing..."

echo "[INFO] Testing GPU detection with nvidia-smi..."
nvidia-smi || { echo "[ERROR] nvidia-smi not working!"; exit 1; }

echo "[INFO] Testing CUDA sample program..."
# Install CUDA samples
CUDA_SAMPLES_DIR=$HOME/NVIDIA_CUDA-$(date +%s)
mkdir -p $CUDA_SAMPLES_DIR
cp -r /usr/local/cuda/samples/* $CUDA_SAMPLES_DIR
cd $CUDA_SAMPLES_DIR/1_Utilities/deviceQuery

echo "[INFO] Building CUDA sample (deviceQuery)..."
make

echo "[INFO] Running CUDA sample (deviceQuery)..."
./deviceQuery

echo "[SUCCESS] CUDA test completed. Look above for GPU details."
âœ… How to use
Copy this script into your VM, for example:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano setup_gpu_cuda.sh
Paste the script and save.

Make it executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x setup_gpu_cuda.sh
Run it:

bash
Copy
Edit
./setup_gpu_cuda.sh | tee gpu_setup.log
Watch output:

nvidia-smi should show your GPU(s).

deviceQuery should print GPU details, CUDA cores, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Your VM must be created with the GPU flavor (with PCI passthrough alias properly configured).

Make sure you reboot the VM after driver installation if CUDA toolkit isnâ€™t detected immediately.

This script is tailored for RHEL 9.x (as in your screenshot) â€“ if using Ubuntu, let me know and Iâ€™ll give you a deb-based version.

If youâ€™d like, I can also provide:
âœ… A version for Ubuntu
âœ… A cleanup script
âœ… Or a quick test Python script (using PyTorch/TensorFlow) to confirm GPU utilization.

Let me know! ðŸš€








You said:
so after ssh into vm we need to run thsi scriot


ChatGPT said:
âœ… Yes! Exactly.
Once you have successfully SSHâ€™d into your GPUâ€‘enabled VM (with the correct keypair), you simply run the script from inside the VM.

ðŸ”‘ Stepâ€‘byâ€‘Step
SSH into your VM:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i <your-keypair.pem> cloud-user@<your-vm-ip>
(Replace cloud-user with your actual username if different, and <your-vm-ip> with the VMâ€™s floating IP.)

Copy or create the script inside the VM:
For example, on the VM:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano setup_gpu_cuda.sh
Paste the script I gave you, save it, and exit.

Make the script executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x setup_gpu_cuda.sh
Run the script (this will install drivers and test CUDA):

bash
Copy
Edit
./setup_gpu_cuda.sh | tee gpu_setup.log
This will:

Install NVIDIA drivers

Install CUDA toolkit

Run nvidia-smi to confirm GPU detection

Compile and run CUDAâ€™s deviceQuery sample to confirm CUDA works

ðŸ“Œ After running:
âœ… You should see your GPU(s) listed by nvidia-smi
âœ… deviceQuery should output detailed GPU info (CUDA cores, memory, etc.)

If you want, I can also:

Help you test with a real CUDA workload (e.g., a PyTorch training script)

Provide instructions for Ubuntu/Debian instead of RHEL

Help troubleshoot if the script shows errors

Just let me know! ðŸš€








You said:
 m8g.xlarge is om gou node how to check woth openstack commnds that it was using gpu


ChatGPT said:
Hereâ€™s exactly how you can check from your OpenStack CLI whether your running VM (for example created with m8g.xlarge flavor) is actually using the GPU node and is GPUâ€‘capable.

âœ… 1. Find the server ID
List your servers and pick the test-gpu-vm (or whatever you named it):

bash
Copy
Edit
openstack server list
Note the ID of your VM.

âœ… 2. Check which host the VM is on
bash
Copy
Edit
openstack server show <SERVER_ID> -f value -c OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host
âœ… Output should show something like:

Copy
Edit
tst-overcloud-compute-gpu-09.openstack.cadence.com
If the hostname includes your GPU node (e.g., gpu in the name or the one you know is in the GPU aggregate), then itâ€™s scheduled on the GPU host.

âœ… 3. Check flavor properties (optional)
Confirm the flavor you used has the GPU passthrough alias:

bash
Copy
Edit
openstack flavor show m8g.xlarge
Look under properties:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
aggregate_instance_extra_specs:host_type='gpu_host'
pci_passthrough:alias='gpu:1'
âœ… 4. Inspect the hypervisor (optional deeper check)
Get the hypervisor details of that host:

bash
Copy
Edit
openstack hypervisor show <HOSTNAME>
It will show CPU, memory, and GPU info available on that hypervisor.
(If SRâ€‘IOV / PCI passthrough is set up, you will see PCI devices listed when using openstack hypervisor show or openstack hypervisor list then openstack hypervisor show <ID>.)

âœ… 5. Inside the VM â€“ confirm CUDA devices
Once you SSH into the VM and install NVIDIA drivers (or if your image already has them):

bash
Copy
Edit
nvidia-smi
âœ… This should list GPU(s) with name, memory, and utilization.

ðŸ”¥ Summary of commands
bash
Copy
Edit
# List all VMs
openstack server list

# Check which compute host the VM is running on
openstack server show <SERVER_ID> -f value -c OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host

# Check flavor properties
openstack flavor show m8g.xlarge

# Check hypervisor info (to confirm GPU host)
openstack hypervisor show <HOSTNAME>
ðŸ‘‰ If you want, I can write a small script to do all of these checks automatically for your test-gpu-vm. Let me know! ðŸš€
