To enhance the deployment pipeline to ensure:

Seamless, isolated deployments per chamber.

Parallel execution of deployments using a matrix strategy.

Readiness for thorough testing in the dev environment.

Work Done
Implemented new code blocks into the GitHub Actions workflow to:

Dynamically detect all changed chambers.

Pass them to a matrix job for isolated parallel deployments.

Added logic to collect chamber-specific paths from the git diff.

Verified flow and outputs from the pre_chamber_deployment job.

Modified the downstream job to loop over the matrix and deploy each chamber independently.

Ensured compatibility between AWS and OpenStack chamber change detection.

Validated parts of the pipeline logic by reviewing workflow behavior on multiple test commits.

Documented and commented on critical areas of the pipeline for better maintainability.

Next Steps
Awaiting WCAG portal access to enable dev-level testing through the front-end interface.

Thoroughly test the enhanced pipeline in the dev environment:

Validate parallelism and isolation per deployment.

Test behavior on simultaneous AWS/OpenStack deployments.

Confirm correct chamber path parsing and variable flow.

Once validated, prepare for promotion to staging or production with test results.
