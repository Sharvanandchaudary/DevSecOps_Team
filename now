Daily Status Report – [Date]

Goal:

Preview and understand the pipeline through the VCAT portal (WCAG portal access).

Explore the full flow of terminating an existing chamber and deploying a new chamber through the portal.

Test the Teradion CLA workflow within the portal to understand how workflows are triggered and monitored.

Investigate issues encountered while deleting a chamber and working through deployment errors.

Perform a walkthrough of the existing Kubernetes cluster hosting GitHub Actions runners.

Review and understand the XA‑1 repository and its integration with cluster deployments.

Work Done:

Accessed the VCAT/WCAG portal and navigated through its main sections:

Verified available chambers and their current status.

Explored the pipeline view to understand which stages handle validation, deployment, and test automation.

Chamber Termination & Deployment Flow:

Followed the documented process to terminate an existing chamber from the portal interface.

Observed how the chamber state changes and which backend steps are triggered during termination (cleanup of resources, runner detachment, etc.).

Initiated the deployment of a new chamber through the same portal, noting required inputs (chamber ID, target environment) and how the pipeline progresses through provisioning and configuration.

Captured key steps where approvals or validations are required.

Encountered and troubleshot issues when deleting a chamber:

A chamber deletion did not fully complete, leading to residual configurations that blocked a redeployment.

Spent time investigating logs and portal error messages, working through these issues to allow a clean termination and redeployment process.

Ran the Teradion CLA workflow within the portal and analyzed the logs to see where artifacts were built, validated, and passed to deployment.

Performed a walkthrough of the existing Kubernetes cluster:

Reviewed runner namespaces, deployment configuration (RunnerDeployment objects), and how scaling is controlled.

Verified pods and checked controller logs for active workflows.

Explored the XA‑1 repository:

Looked into its folder structure, manifests, and integration points with the VCAT portal and Kubernetes cluster.
