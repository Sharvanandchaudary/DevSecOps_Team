Goal:
Establish a reliable mechanism in the workflow to pick the exact commit SHA and isolate the corresponding chamber values. Begin implementing validation checks to ensure that the workflow only proceeds when the chamber values match the expected configuration.

Work Done:
Implemented logic to capture the commit SHA immediately after checkout and pass it as a reference throughout the workflow.
Updated the validation script to cross‑verify the captured SHA against the chamber configuration, ensuring the workflow does not pick stale or incorrect chamber values.
Introduced additional logging and debug outputs to monitor which SHA and chamber values are being used at every step.
Ran multiple controlled test triggers of the workflow at one‑minute intervals to observe behavior and ensure isolation is working as intended.
Documented results from each run and adjusted the validation conditions to handle edge cases where new commits arrive in quick succession.

Goal:
Ensure that parallel deployments are fully isolated by using concurrency controls, finalize the validation logic, and thoroughly test the workflow under rapid and repeated triggers.

Work Done:

Added a concurrency block in the GitHub Actions workflow, using a unique key derived from commit SHA and chamber ID to prevent overlapping runs from interfering with each other.
Enhanced validation steps to include explicit checks for chamber IDs, environment variables, and output artifacts, ensuring they match the commit under test.
Re‑tested the workflow by triggering parallel deployments at short intervals, confirming that each run operated in its own isolated context without picking incorrect values.
Integrated all improvements into the main workflow and performed end‑to‑end tests every minute for an extended period to confirm stability and reliability.
Prepared internal notes detailing the implementation changes, observed results, and recommended follow‑up actions for future enhancements.
