Goal:
Make the RHEL 8.6 image boot successfully on a bare metal instance.

Work Done:
	•	Verified and tested the RHEL 8.6 image thoroughly in a virtual environment.
	•	Copied the finalized image into the target OpenStack environment.
	•	Configured SSH access by injecting the required public keys and verified connectivity.
	•	Ensured proper boot functionality — the image booted successfully on a Dell R660 bare metal server.
	•	Resolved issues related to SSH login failure by debugging cloud-init and system configurations.
	•	Addressed configuration mismatches that came with the default Red Hat ISO image — updated default settings to align with internal environment.
	•	Validated that the image was using EFI boot and included correct partition layout.
	•	Confirmed that the image could utilize full bare metal capacity (1.7TB disk, all CPUs, and memory) post-deployment.
	•	Successfully provisioned the bare metal instance using Ironic and verified that it matched expected hardware specifications.
	•	Deployed the instance in a test chamber and validated end-to-end SSH access and service readiness.







GitHub Pull Request Branching Strategy (PR Perspective Only)
Set up protected branch rules for main:

Require a pull request before merging

Require at least 1 or 2 approvals before merging

Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed

Require status checks to pass before merging (for example: build, test, checklist-validator)

Require branches to be up to date before merging

Restrict who can push directly to the protected branch (typically only maintainers or DevOps team)

Do not allow force pushes or branch deletion

Enable automatic deletion of merged branches:

Go to repository settings under General > Pull Requests

Turn on "Automatically delete head branches"

Enforce branch naming conventions:

Feature branches: feature/issue-id-description

Bugfix branches: bugfix/issue-id-description

Release branches: release/version

Hotfix branches: hotfix/issue-description

Use draft pull requests:

Encourage developers to open PRs early as drafts to allow for early feedback

Draft PRs do not trigger merge checks until marked "Ready for review"

Enforce all PRs to pass required checks:

Use GitHub Actions workflows for PR checklist validation and reviewer verification

In branch protection settings, ensure that all required checks must pass before merge

Disallow direct commits to main and release branches:

Only allow pull requests to update protected branches

Configure push restrictions under branch protection rules
