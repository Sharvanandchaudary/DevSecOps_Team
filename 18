Goal:

Validate the parallel deployment process by running simultaneous deployments and deletions for multiple chambers (TB08 and TB10) to ensure the workflow handles concurrency without errors.

Test and confirm that chamber deletion tasks complete cleanly without leaving residual resources or configuration mismatches.

Review and test host aggregate configurations to make sure the correct flavors are being applied for provisioning on the expected compute nodes.

Identify and resolve any misconfigurations (such as incorrect flavor mappings), then raise a pull request for the fixes and verify them in a test environment before merging.

Work Done:

Successfully ran parallel deployments for TB08 and TB10 while simultaneously initiating chamber deletion tasks. Verified that both processes executed without conflicts and system stability was maintained.

Carefully observed the logs and confirmed that deletion workflows cleaned up resources properly, leaving no orphaned volumes or ports.

Raised a detailed pull request containing code/configuration changes that support stable parallel deployment and chamber deletion. Documented the changes and test results in the PR description.

Conducted an in‑depth test of host aggregate settings and discovered that one of the flavors was incorrectly configured as smallme instead of the intended lowme.

Corrected the flavor configuration in the environment, then re‑deployed and tested in the test environment.

Confirmed that with the corrected flavor mapping, the system successfully provisions instances on the correct compute nodes without errors or scheduling conflicts.

Recorded the updated configuration and testing steps for future reference and shared results with the team for review.
